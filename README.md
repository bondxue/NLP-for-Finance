## PART 1: NLP on Financial Statements

In this project, I have done NLP Anlysis on 10-k financial statements to generate an alpha factor. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia and Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists.



## PART 2: Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks 

In this project, I have built deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/), a social network for investors and traders. My model is able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, I am able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.
